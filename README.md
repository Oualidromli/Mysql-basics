_MySQL, SQL language, setting environment variables._

Description :

Intro pill which served as our first contact with the DBMS "MySQL", where we set an environment variable to be able to run the program from the command line, imported an example database from a ".sql" file provided by the official MySQL team, and executed some queries to play around with a DB and to getting familiar with the SQL language.

This repository contains the following files:

** - README.md - **
** - queries.sql - ** <---- in this file is saved all the commands used and necessary to do this exercise.
